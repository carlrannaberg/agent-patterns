# Evaluation Framework Implementation Sequencing

This document outlines the proper sequence and dependencies for implementing the evaluation framework.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Issue #7)
**Dependencies**: None
**Description**: Sets up the core evaluation infrastructure that all other phases depend on.
- Core evaluation service structure
- Base LLM-as-judge class
- Test case data structures
- Evaluation result schemas

### Phase 2: Pattern-Specific Implementation (Issue #8)
**Dependencies**: Issue #7 must be completed
**Description**: Implements evaluation logic for each of the 6 agent patterns.
- Pattern-specific evaluators
- Test case generators
- Evaluation prompts and rubrics

### Phase 2b: Calibration & Bias Mitigation (Issue #9)
**Dependencies**: Issues #7 and #8 must be completed
**Description**: Ensures evaluation reliability and fairness.
- Gold dataset collection
- Human baseline scoring
- Calibration mechanisms
- Can be done in parallel with Phase 3

### Phase 3: Automation & Integration (Issue #10)
**Dependencies**: Issues #7 and #8 must be completed
**Description**: Enables automated evaluation execution.
- Test runner implementation
- API integration
- Batch processing
- Can be done in parallel with Phase 2b

### Phase 4: Reporting & Analytics (Issue #11)
**Dependencies**: Issues #7, #8, and #10 must be completed
**Description**: Provides data storage and analysis capabilities.
- Database schema
- Results storage
- Analytics APIs

### Phase 5: Dashboard & Visualization (Issue #12)
**Dependencies**: Issue #11 must be completed
**Description**: Creates the user interface for evaluation results.
- React dashboard
- Visualizations
- Real-time monitoring

## Parallel Work Opportunities

1. **Issues #9 and #10** can be worked on simultaneously after #7 and #8 are complete
2. **Documentation** can be created alongside implementation
3. **Testing** should be done within each phase

## Critical Path

The critical path for the evaluation framework:
```
Issue #7 → Issue #8 → Issue #10 → Issue #11 → Issue #12
```

Issue #9 (Calibration) can be done in parallel but should be completed before production use.

## Notes

- Issue #6 appears to be a duplicate of Issue #7 and should be ignored
- Each phase builds upon the previous ones
- Testing should be integrated throughout, not left until the end
