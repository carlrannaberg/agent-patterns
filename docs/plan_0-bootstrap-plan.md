# Plan for Issue 0: Decompose Project Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/0-bootstrap-plan.md`.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Read the master plan:** Open and read the contents of `plan.md`.
2.  **Identify major tasks:** Identify the four top-level tasks: "1.0 Project & Developer Experience Setup", "2.0 Backend (Nest.js) Implementation", "3.0 Frontend (React) Implementation", and "4.0 API Testing".
3.  **Create issues via script:** For each major task, execute the `npm run issue "<task-title>"` command.
4.  **Populate issue and plan files:**
    -   Open each newly created file (`issues/<id>-<title>.md` and `docs/plan_<id>-<title>.md`).
    -   Copy the relevant notes, requirements, and sub-tasks from the master `plan.md` into the corresponding new files. Ensure the detailed code snippets and checklists are preserved in the `docs/plan_...` files.
