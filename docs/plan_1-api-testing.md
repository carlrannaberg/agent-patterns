# Plan for Issue 1: API Testing

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/1-api-testing.md`.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Vitest Configuration**
   - [ ] 4.1 Configure Vitest in the `api` package

2. **API Endpoint Tests**
   - [ ] 4.2 Write API tests for each of the six endpoints, mocking the AI SDK calls to ensure the services are wired correctly:
     - [ ] `/sequential-processing` - Test marketing copy generation flow
     - [ ] `/routing` - Test customer query classification and routing  
     - [ ] `/parallel-processing` - Test concurrent code review functionality
     - [ ] `/orchestrator-worker` - Test feature implementation planning
     - [ ] `/evaluator-optimizer` - Test iterative translation improvement
     - [ ] `/multi-step-tool-usage` - Test mathematical problem solving

## Key Testing Notes
- **Testing Framework**: Use Vitest for API-level tests
- **Mocking Strategy**: Mock AI SDK calls to ensure the services are wired correctly without making actual AI API calls
- **Test Coverage**: Each endpoint should have tests that verify:
  - Proper request handling
  - Service integration
  - Response structure
  - Error handling
- **Test Isolation**: Tests should be independent and not rely on external AI services
