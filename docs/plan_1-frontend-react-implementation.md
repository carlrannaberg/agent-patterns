# Plan for Issue 1: Frontend (React) Implementation

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/1-frontend-react-implementation.md`.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Router Configuration**
   - [ ] 3.1 Configure `react-router-dom` with routes for each of the six patterns

2. **Main Layout Component**
   - [ ] 3.2 Create a main `Layout` component with navigation links to each pattern's page

3. **Reusable AgentInteraction Component**
   - [ ] 3.3.1 Create a reusable `AgentInteraction` component that uses the `useObject` hook to manage state and API communication
   - [ ] 3.3.2 Include a `react-textarea-autosize` input and a submit button
   - [ ] 3.3.3 Display the streamed `object` from the hook in a `<pre>` tag

4. **Individual Pattern Pages**
   - [ ] 3.4 Create the six page components, each using `AgentInteraction` and providing the correct API endpoint path:
     - Sequential Processing page (`/sequential-processing`)
     - Routing page (`/routing`) 
     - Parallel Processing page (`/parallel-processing`)
     - Orchestrator-Worker page (`/orchestrator-worker`)
     - Evaluator-Optimizer page (`/evaluator-optimizer`)
     - Multi-Step Tool Usage page (`/multi-step-tool-usage`)

## Key Technical Notes
- **Frontend**: A React.js application built with Vite and Material UI. Each pattern will have its own page
- **Streaming & API Communication**: The React frontend will use the `useObject` hook from `ai/react` to consume and render the streamed data
- **UI Components**: Use Material UI for consistent styling and components
- **API Integration**: Each page component should connect to its corresponding backend endpoint and handle streaming responses
