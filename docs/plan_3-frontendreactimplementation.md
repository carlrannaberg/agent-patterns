# Plan for Issue 3: Frontend (React) Implementation

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to complete `issues/3-frontendreactimplementation.md`.

## Implementation Plan

- [ ] 3.1 Configure `react-router-dom` with routes for each of the six patterns
- [ ] 3.2 Create a main `Layout` component with navigation links to each pattern's page  
- [ ] 3.3 Create a reusable `AgentInteraction` component
  - [ ] 3.3.1 It should use the `useObject` hook to manage state and API communication
  - [ ] 3.3.2 Include a `react-textarea-autosize` input and a submit button
  - [ ] 3.3.3 Display the streamed `object` from the hook in a `<pre>` tag
- [ ] 3.4 Create the six page components, each using `AgentInteraction` and providing the correct API endpoint path
  - [ ] Sequential Processing page (`/sequential-processing`)
  - [ ] Routing page (`/routing`)
  - [ ] Parallel Processing page (`/parallel-processing`) 
  - [ ] Orchestrator-Worker page (`/orchestrator-worker`)
  - [ ] Evaluator-Optimizer page (`/evaluator-optimizer`)
  - [ ] Multi-Step Tool Usage page (`/multi-step-tool-usage`)

## Component Structure

### Layout Component
- Navigation using Material UI AppBar and Drawer
- Links to all six pattern pages
- Responsive design

### AgentInteraction Component  
- Uses `useObject` hook from `ai/react`
- Textarea input with autosize
- Submit button with loading state
- Streaming results display in formatted JSON
- Error handling

### Pattern Pages
Each page will:
- Use the `AgentInteraction` component
- Provide pattern-specific API endpoint
- Include pattern description and usage instructions
- Show example inputs for demonstration
