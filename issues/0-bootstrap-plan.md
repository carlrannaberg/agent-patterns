## Requirement
Read the master `plan.md` file and decompose its major sections (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0) into the structured issue/plan format required for execution.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `todo.md` file is populated with entries for all the newly created issues.
- The content of each new issue and plan file accurately reflects the details from the master `plan.md`.
