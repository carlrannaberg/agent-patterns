# Issue 3: Frontend (React) Implementation

## Requirement
Build a React.js frontend with Material UI that provides interactive interfaces for all six agent patterns using streaming AI responses.

## Acceptance Criteria
- React Router configured with routes for each of the six patterns
- Main Layout component with navigation links to each pattern's page
- Reusable AgentInteraction component that:
  - Uses the `useObject` hook for state and API communication
  - Includes a `react-textarea-autosize` input and submit button
  - Displays streamed `object` data in a `<pre>` tag
- Six page components created, each using AgentInteraction with the correct API endpoint
