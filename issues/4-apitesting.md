# Issue 4: API Testing

## Requirement
Configure Vitest testing framework and write comprehensive API tests for all six backend endpoints to ensure proper functionality and integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vitest configured in the `api` package
- [ ] API tests written for all six endpoints with mocked AI SDK calls:
  - [ ] Sequential Processing endpoint (`/sequential-processing`)
  - [ ] Routing endpoint (`/routing`)
  - [ ] Parallel Processing endpoint (`/parallel-processing`)
  - [ ] Orchestrator-Worker endpoint (`/orchestrator-worker`)
  - [ ] Evaluator-Optimizer endpoint (`/evaluator-optimizer`)
  - [ ] Multi-Step Tool Usage endpoint (`/multi-step-tool-usage`)
- [ ] Tests verify service wiring and controller response structure
- [ ] Mock implementations prevent actual AI API calls during testing
