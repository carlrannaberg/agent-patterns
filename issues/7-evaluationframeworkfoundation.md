# Issue 7: Evaluation Framework Foundation

## Requirement
Implement the foundational components of the evaluation framework, including the core evaluation service structure in NestJS, base LLM-as-judge evaluation class, test case data structures, evaluation result schemas, and G-Eval rubric parser with score normalizer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Set up evaluation service structure in NestJS with proper module organization
- [x] Create base LLM-as-judge evaluation class with configurable judge models
- [x] Implement test case data structures (TestCase, EvaluationConfig interfaces)
- [x] Design evaluation result schemas (MetricScore, EvaluationResult interfaces)
- [x] Integrate G-Eval rubric parser and score normalizer
- [x] Create evaluation module with dependency injection
- [x] Add configuration support for multiple judge backends (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude-3, local vLLM/Ollama)
- [x] Implement basic evaluation service with execute method
- [x] Add unit tests for all core components
- [x] Document evaluation service architecture and usage
