# Issue 7: Evaluation Framework Foundation

## Requirement
Implement the foundational components of the evaluation framework, including the core evaluation service structure in NestJS, base LLM-as-judge evaluation class, test case data structures, evaluation result schemas, and G-Eval rubric parser with score normalizer.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Set up evaluation service structure in NestJS with proper module organization
- [ ] Create base LLM-as-judge evaluation class with configurable judge models
- [ ] Implement test case data structures (TestCase, EvaluationConfig interfaces)
- [ ] Design evaluation result schemas (MetricScore, EvaluationResult interfaces)
- [ ] Integrate G-Eval rubric parser and score normalizer
- [ ] Create evaluation module with dependency injection
- [ ] Add configuration support for multiple judge backends (Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude-3, local vLLM/Ollama)
- [ ] Implement basic evaluation service with execute method
- [ ] Add unit tests for all core components
- [ ] Document evaluation service architecture and usage
