# Issue 8: Pattern-Specific Evaluation Implementation

## Requirement
Implement pattern-specific evaluation components including evaluation prompts, test case generators, scoring logic, and validation rules for each of the 6 agent patterns (Sequential Processing, Routing, Parallel Processing, Orchestrator-Worker, Evaluator-Optimizer, Multi-Step Tool Usage).

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create evaluation prompts for each pattern with pattern-specific criteria
- [ ] Implement test case generators per pattern with diverse scenarios
- [ ] Build pattern-specific scoring logic based on defined metrics
- [ ] Create validation rules for each metric (pass/fail binary checks)
- [ ] Implement evaluators for Sequential Processing (marketing copy)
- [ ] Implement evaluators for Routing (customer support)
- [ ] Implement evaluators for Parallel Processing (code review)
- [ ] Implement evaluators for Orchestrator-Worker (feature implementation)
- [ ] Implement evaluators for Evaluator-Optimizer (translation)
- [ ] Implement evaluators for Multi-Step Tool Usage (math problems)
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for each pattern evaluator
- [ ] Document pattern-specific evaluation criteria and usage
