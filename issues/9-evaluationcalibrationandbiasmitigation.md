# Issue 9: Evaluation Calibration and Bias Mitigation

## Requirement
Implement calibration mechanisms and bias mitigation strategies for the evaluation framework, including gold dataset collection, human baseline scoring, rubric weight tuning, and randomization features to ensure reliable and unbiased evaluations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Collect 100-sample gold dataset per pattern (600 total samples)
- [ ] Implement human scoring interface for baseline establishment
- [ ] Compute baseline human scores for all gold samples
- [ ] Tune rubric weights to maximize Spearman correlation with human scores
- [ ] Enable position randomization in judge service
- [ ] Implement length normalization for fair scoring
- [ ] Add cross-model ensemble evaluation support
- [ ] Create calibration service with periodic re-anchoring
- [ ] Implement Krippendorff's alpha reliability calculations
- [ ] Add bootstrap confidence intervals for scores
- [ ] Build bias detection and alerting system
- [ ] Document calibration methodology and schedule
