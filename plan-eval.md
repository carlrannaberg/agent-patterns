# Agent Patterns Evaluation Framework Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of an automated evaluation framework for the agent patterns API using LLM-as-judge methodology. The framework will systematically test each agent pattern endpoint, evaluate responses using Gemini models, and provide comprehensive quality metrics.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Core Evaluation System
- **LLM-as-Judge Service**: G-Eval–powered engine (supports Gemini, GPT-4o, Claude-3, local vLLM/Ollama backends)
- **Bias & Calibration Module**: position/length randomizer, score-normalizer, Krippendorff-α reliability checks
- **Test Case Generator**: Automated generation of diverse test scenarios
- **API Test Runner**: Automated execution of API tests
- **Results Aggregator**: Score compilation and analysis
- **Reporting Dashboard**: Visualization of evaluation results

### 2. Evaluation Metrics by Pattern

#### Sequential Processing (Marketing Copy)

#### Routing (Customer Support)
- **Classification Accuracy**: Is the query categorized correctly? (pass/fail)
- **Response Relevance**: Is the routed response appropriate for the query? (pass/fail)

- **Task Decomposition**: Is the work logically broken down? (pass/fail)
- **Execution Simulation**: Are the implementation steps realistic? (pass/fail)
- **Coordination Efficiency**: Is the orchestration logic correct? (pass/fail)

#### Evaluator-Optimizer (Translation)
- **Translation Accuracy**: Does the translation preserve the original meaning? (pass/fail)
- **Fluency**: Does it read naturally in the target language? (pass/fail)
- **Improvement Iterations**: Is the optimized translation better than the initial one? (pass/fail)
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Is the localization appropriate? (pass/fail)

#### Multi-Step Tool Usage (Math Problems)
- **Tool Selection Accuracy**: Was the correct tool chosen for each step? (pass/fail)
- **Computation Correctness**: Is the final result mathematically accurate? (pass/fail)
- **Step Efficiency**: Was the solution path optimal? (pass/fail)
- **Explanation Clarity**: Is the reasoning clear and easy to follow? (pass/fail)

### 4. Technical Implementation Details

#### Evaluation Service Structure
```typescript
interface EvaluationMetric {
  name: string; // e.g. "Content Quality"
  binaryChecks: string[]; // e.g. ["Is relevant?", "Is creative?", "Aligns with brand?"]
}

interface EvaluationConfig {
  pattern: AgentPattern;
  metrics: EvaluationMetric[];
  testCases: TestCase[];
  judgeModel: string;  // 'gpt-4o' | 'gemini-1.5-pro' | 'local-vllm'
}

interface MetricScore {
  metric: string;
  check: string;
  pass: boolean;
  reasoning: string;
}

interface EvaluationResult {
  patternId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  scores: MetricScore[];
  aggregatePassRate: number; // Percentage of checks that passed
  details: EvaluationDetails; // e.g., per-metric pass rates
  reliability: number; // Krippendorff Alpha
}
```

#### Test Case Generation Strategy
- **Diverse Inputs**: Normal, edge cases, adversarial
- **Complexity Levels**: Simple, moderate, complex scenarios
- **Domain Coverage**: Various industries/contexts
- **Language Variations**: Multiple languages for applicable patterns

#### LLM Judge Implementation

- **Rubric Design**: Decomposed binary checks (pass/fail) per evaluation criterion
- **Bias Mitigation**: position shuffling, length-normalized scoring, cross-model ensembles
- **Reliability Checks**: Krippendorff-α & bootstrap CIs
- **Calibration**: 100-sample gold sets re-anchored quarterly
- **Caching & Dedup**: hash-based result store to skip duplicate evals

### 5. Evaluation Workflow

1. **Test Case Selection**
   - Generate or select pre-defined test cases
   - Ensure coverage across difficulty levels
   - Include pattern-specific edge cases

2. **API Execution**

   - Capture full response including streaming data
   - Record performance metrics (latency, tokens)

3. **LLM Evaluation**
   - Submit response to LLM judge with criteria
   - Collect scores for each metric
   - Request reasoning for scores

4. **Result Aggregation**
   - Compile individual metric scores
   - Calculate weighted aggregate score
   - Identify patterns in failures/successes

5. **Reporting**
   - Store results in database
   - Update dashboard metrics
   - Generate alerts for score degradation
